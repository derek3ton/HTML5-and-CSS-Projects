# HTML5-and-CSS-Projects

This is a display of sample websites I made using HTML and CSS. 

Projects:

The Space Station: This site is an example of a page for a space flight and travel company.  It is styled using HTML5 and CSS amd contains a NavBar, photo container, and a contact form.  

The Academy Cinemas: This is an example of a theater's home page.  It is styled using HTML5, CSS, and Bootstrap.  It contains a NavBar, jumbotron, forms, cards and a drop down.
